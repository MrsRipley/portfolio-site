                <h2>Designer and aspiring developer from Watertown,SD</h2>
                <p class="about">Thanks for stopping to learn a little bit more about me. I grew up as an Army Brat; we moved around a lot and we were constantly on the go. One thing that was a constant for me was the need to be creative. I grew up with a passion for art that has turned into a career in Graphic Design. When I graduated from college, at the University of Minnesota, I was ready to put some roots down and decided to move back to my hometown of Watertown, SD. I then met my husband and we now have two kids and a springer spaniel. I work full time as a designer/digital strategist for Pivotal Health Solutions and always seem to have at least one project on the side. In the fall of 2020, mid-quarantine, I made the leap to take the introductory SheCodes class. Coding has always been something that I wanted to add to to my skillset and what better time than during a global pandemic? I liked it so much that I also finished SheCodes Plus, React and Responsive. Take a look at my projects below or see My Work page for some of my design work. </p>
